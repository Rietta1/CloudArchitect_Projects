# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture



### Install and verify AWS CLI

I installed the aws cli using gitpod, i downloaded my credential from aws and added them to gitpod.

### Created IAM User

i created IAM user and added authentication using Authy because i can use Authy on both mobile phones and desktop, i gave the user admin privellages by creating a user group and adding it.

### Create a Budget

- I created my own Budget for $3 because that is how much spend i can afford.

- I did not create a second Budget because i created a billing alarm using **cloudwatch** and **sns**, and i also setup **85% freeteir use alert** and i was also concerned of budget spending going over the 2 budget free limit.

- I also used the AWS console to Create them because , these was amongst the first task i carried out before installing the aws cli on gitpod
